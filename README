minetest-australopithecus-experiment-ramps
==========================================

A simple experiment how the world of Minetest can look like with Dwarf Fortress
like ramps.

These ramps can have two modes (switchable in the parameters.lua file),
default is the mesh mode, but you can change it to nodeboxes.

The game directory is assumed to have the name "ramps" and it is a subgame, so
be sure to place it in the correct directory and give it the correct name.

Also note that there is no security mechanism in place to prevent you from
spawning inside nodes, so use fly/noclip.


Known issues
============

 * Block borders are a problem and yield odd artifacts.
